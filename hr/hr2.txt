Human Resources (HR) is a crucial function within any organization, responsible for managing and developing the company's most valuable asset: its people. HR professionals play a vital role in attracting, selecting, and retaining talented individuals who align with the organization's goals and values. They work closely with hiring managers to create job descriptions, post vacancies, and evaluate resumes and applications. HR teams conduct interviews, assess candidates' qualifications, and make recommendations for final selection. By effectively managing the recruitment process, HR helps the organization build a skilled and diverse workforce.

Once new employees are hired, HR professionals facilitate the onboarding process. They welcome new hires, provide them with necessary information about the company, its policies, and procedures, and ensure that they have the required resources to succeed in their roles. HR also handles the paperwork associated with employee onboarding, such as contracts, tax forms, and benefits enrollment. Effective onboarding sets the stage for employees to become productive and engaged members of the organization.
