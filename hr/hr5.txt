Compensation and benefits management is another vital area within HR. HR professionals develop and administer competitive salary structures, benefits packages, and incentive programs to attract and retain top talent. They conduct salary surveys, analyze market trends, and ensure fair and equitable compensation practices. HR also manages employee benefits, such as health insurance, retirement plans, and wellness initiatives, to support employees' overall well-being.
