Organizational development and change management are strategic areas within HR. HR professionals assist in managing organizational change, such as mergers, acquisitions, or restructuring, by providing guidance on change initiatives, communicating with employees, and facilitating transition plans. They also collaborate with senior management to develop and implement strategic HR initiatives aligned with the organization's goals and objectives.
