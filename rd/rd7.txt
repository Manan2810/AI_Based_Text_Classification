One of the key components of R&D is applied research, which aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. Applied research focuses on solving specific problems or addressing industry-specific challenges. It involves testing hypotheses, developing prototypes, and validating concepts to assess their feasibility and potential for commercialization.
