The AI-based text classification project aims to develop a sophisticated machine learning model that can automatically classify text documents into predefined categories or topics. The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically text classification algorithms, to enable efficient and accurate categorization of large volumes of unstructured text data.
