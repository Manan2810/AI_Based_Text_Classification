Financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies, and asset management firms, are key players in the finance industry. Banks serve as intermediaries between savers and borrowers, providing loans, managing deposits, and offering a range of financial services. Insurance companies protect individuals and businesses against potential risks by providing coverage and financial compensation. Asset management firms oversee investment portfolios on behalf of clients and strive to maximize returns while managing risks.
