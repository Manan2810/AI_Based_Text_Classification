Valuation is the process of determining the intrinsic value of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and businesses. Various valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, and comparable company analysis, are employed to estimate the fair value of these assets.
