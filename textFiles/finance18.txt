Behavioral finance is an emerging field that combines psychology and finance to study how individuals and markets make financial decisions. It explores biases, cognitive limitations, and emotional factors that influence investor behavior and market outcomes. Behavioral finance helps understand phenomena such as market bubbles, herding behavior, and irrational exuberance.
Sustainable finance, also known as green finance or socially responsible investing, focuses on integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into investment decisions. It aims to support sustainable development, address climate change, and promote ethical business practices. Sustainable finance considers the long-term impact of investments on society, the environment, and corporate governance practices.
