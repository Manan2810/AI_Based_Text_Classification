R&D is not limited to large corporations or high-tech industries. Organizations of all sizes and across various sectors can benefit from R&D activities. Small businesses can leverage R&D efforts to differentiate themselves in the market, develop niche products, and explore new markets. R&D also plays a crucial role in the public sector, where government agencies and research institutions focus on scientific exploration, health advancements, and societal progress.
