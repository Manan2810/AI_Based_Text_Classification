The process of R&D involves several stages, starting with idea generation, where potential research areas are identified through market analysis and technology scanning. Once an idea is chosen, research planning ensues, which includes defining objectives, setting timelines, allocating resources, and establishing research methodologies. A thorough literature review follows, enabling researchers to understand the current state of knowledge, identify research gaps, and establish a theoretical foundation for the study. Experimental design is the subsequent step, wherein researchers design experiments or prototypes to test hypotheses and validate the feasibility of ideas. Data collection and analysis come next, where researchers collect data through various methods and employ statistical techniques to draw conclusions and make informed decisions. The results and findings are then documented and communicated through reports, scientific papers, or presentations, facilitating knowledge sharing and validation. Finally, successful research findings are implemented, commercialized, and translated into practical applications, which may involve further development, product design, regulatory compliance, and market testing
