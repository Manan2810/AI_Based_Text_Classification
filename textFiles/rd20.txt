To foster a culture of innovation and R&D within organizations, leaders must prioritize and support R&D initiatives. This includes allocating resources, providing funding, creating a supportive work environment, and encouraging a mindset that embraces experimentation and learning from failure. Organizations that value R&D as a strategic function are more likely to succeed in today's fast-paced and competitive business landscape.
